* When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop the animation. 

* Displayed above every gif is it's title and rating (PG, G, so on) provided from the API.

* The user can remove the topic button from the HTML page by double-clicking the button.
